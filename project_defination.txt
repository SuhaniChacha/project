Image classifier

Here I have tried to generate an image classifier that classifies that the object in given image is orange or apple. For this purpose I have taken 
20 images as training data and 6 images as testing data. I am using keras to implement classifier with backend theona. I am using concept of neural 
networks over here. Initially I am only creating 3 layers and the model used here is Sequential.
NBS - is my database folder(where i have my training,testing and validating images)
